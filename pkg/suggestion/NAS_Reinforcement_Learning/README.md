# About the Nerual Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning Suggestion

The algorithm follows the idea proposed in *Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning* by Zoph & Le (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578), and the implementation is based on the github of *EfÔ¨Åcient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing* (https://github.com/melodyguan/enas). It uses a recurrent nerual network with LSTM cells as controller to generate nerual archiecture canddiates. And this controller network is updated by policy gradients. However, it curretnly does not support parameter sharing. 

## Definition of a Nerual Architecture

Denote n as the number of layers, m as the number of possible operations

If n = 12, m = 6, the definition of an architecture will be like:

```
[2]
[0 0]
[1 1 0]
[5 1 0 1]
[1 1 1 0 1]
[5 0 0 1 0 1]
[1 1 1 0 0 1 0]
[2 0 0 0 1 1 0 1]
[0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0]
[2 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0]
[3 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1]
[0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0]
```

There are n rows, i<sup>th</sup> row describes i<sup>th</sup> layer with i elements. Please notice that layer 0 is the input and is not included in this definition.

In each row:
The first integer ranges from 0 to m-1, indicates the operation in this layer.
The next (i-1) integers is either 0 or 1. The k<sup>th</sup> integer indicates whether (k-2)<sup>th</sup> layer has a skip connection with this layer. (There will always be a connection from (k-1)<sup>th</sup> layer to k<sup>th</sup> layer)

## Output of `GetSuggestion()`
The output of `GetSuggestion()` consists of two parts: `architecture` and `nn_config`.

`architecture` is a json string of the deinition of a nerual architecture. The format is as stated above. One example is:
```
[[22], [9, 1], [2, 0, 1], [7, 1, 1, 1], [20, 1, 0, 0, 1], [12, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [14, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]]
```

`nn_config` is a json string of the detailed description of what is the num of layers, input size, output size and what each operation index stands for. A nn_config corresponding to the architecuture above can be:
```

    }
